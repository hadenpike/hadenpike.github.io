I'm a programmer, obsessive reader, constant learner, and am familiar with the operation of more musical instruments than most people who aren't Music Majors. I do not sing. Ever. And if you value your speakers/headphones/ears/all-the-breakable-items-in-your-house, you'll be glad of that fact. I enjoy finding the most random bits of information I possibly can. Loquacious is not a term which has ever been used to describe me---nor is sane, for that matter. Descriptions of most of the interesting things I do can be found somewhere
    around here.
